# Temwirk
DA Project (Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles)

## Aim
To build a motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. To predict how cars, cyclists,and pedestrians move in the AV's environment.

## Project Code Base
We have utilized the kaggle cloud notebooks, the links for the same [model code](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk/) and [visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation).

Links:
* [Code for the Model](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk) 
* [Code for the Visualizations](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation)

## Dataset
The dataset can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation/data)
The link to the parts of dataset can be found here
* [Scenes](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation/data?select=scenes)
* [Aerial Maps](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation/data?select=aerial_map)
* [Semantic Maps](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshkkumar127/temwirk-visualisation/data?select=semantic_map)

## Steps to view the output/execution
As our dataset is very large we have shared the link to our pre-executed notebook which has submission csv file attached to it. The code can be executed again in the kaggle platform however it would take a minimum of 2hrs for the entire execution with constant monitoring so that the notebook doesnt remain idle and stop.

## Submission Proof
We attained a score of 23.610 which can be viewed below
